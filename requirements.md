Our project requirements (in order by precedent):

* Reverse engineer intitial handshaking and image transefer protocol
* Implement driver in portable software language (C/C++)
* Implement Command Line Interface (CLI) for driver

Additional goals (if time allows):

* Reverse engineer settings/speed protocol
* Reverse engineer images storage protocol
* Pre-process raster image to minimize cutting time
