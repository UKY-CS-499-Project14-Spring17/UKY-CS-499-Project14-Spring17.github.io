title: Meeting Log - Feb. 13
---

We met in the ECE lab again in Marksbury. Lucian had a version of the control program on his virtual machine and we tried to connect the engraver to start capturing communication data. We could not get the program to connect to the engraver. Several settings were adjusted on the virtual machine and we tried installing drivers manually but we weren't able to get the engraver to connect. We did find out that there are 2 versions of the control program though and we couldn't get the other version. We ended the meeting without being able to connect the engraver but Lucian was going to talk to Dr. Dietz about getting the version of the program we know works.
