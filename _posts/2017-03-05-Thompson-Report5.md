### Mar. 05, 2017

The team met on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday this week. Most of the week was devoted to finishing the slides and design report for the website. Monday I worked on the block diagram with Grant. Wednesday we had our meeting with the professor during class time, which went well, and we met in the ECE lab during our normal time at 2. We worked primarily on the slides on Wednesday to prepare for our required presentation to the eStudio on Friday. Friday we met during normal class time outside of the eStudio to finalize the slides and practice with each other before going to the eStudio. We didn't present to the eStudio due to time constraints until our normal meeting time at 2. The presentation went well and we only need a little more polishing before we present on Wednesday. After the eStudio we met in the ECE lab and did a little more reverse engineering and Lucian was able to start sending instructions to the engraver from the command line. We may be able to have a demo for our presentation. I have spent most of my time this week tweeking the slides and I also added a lot of content to the design report. 

I left a few comments on the design page that are not visible when viewing the design page on the website. You have to be able to edit it to see the comments, but the one I want to put here is about the design of the program. Right now the thought is that the program will have to be called every time you want to do something, but I feel that a better approach would be to open it and then stay open, interpreting commands until the user quits the program.
