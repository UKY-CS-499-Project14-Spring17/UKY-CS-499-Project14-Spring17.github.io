title: Meeting Log - Feb. 20
---

The team met to discuss the results of the previous tests and pursue new trials. We tested three designs on the engraver: a horizontal line, a vertical line, and a staircase pattern - alternating rise and run on the page. We ran the vertical line test twice in order to examine the difference (if any) between the trials. The trials differed, although we have not yet determined the significance of the differing values. At one point, the team encountered an error that lead to a crash of the engraver. The hardware continues to operate without issue afterwards. Wireshark was running during the crash, so we do have insight into the after-effects of the crash, though this has not been examined yet. All of this info has been uploaded to the [repository](UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew).

We continued discussion of our High-Level Design and the [accompanying page](hld.md) on our website. Our goal is to complete work on this design this week and prepare our presentation for Wednesday, March 1st. We have discussed and confirmed our environment and user screens, though we have not settled all the parameters that a engraving program may need. More work will be needed to determine data flow and a format sizing estimate.
