The team met with Dr. Dietz and discussed requirements. Details were added regarding requirements and platforms.

Agreements: Requirements were agreed upon. Dr. Deitz also decided to buy the team its own engraver and give us access to the lab in Marksbury where the current engraver is stored.

Grant made changes to the webpage while Lucian sent an email to Dr. Deitz as specified with all of our UK ID information to gain us access to the lab.

The platform will be designed and tested for Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04, though we expect that all major distributions of Linux should be compatible with this program. Target language is C/C++, pending library availability. Requirements are now listed in priority order on the homepage.
