### Mar. 26, 2017

We only met on Wednesday this week. I personally had a lot to do at work so although I could have met it was nicer that we didn't. Hopefully my work won't be as busy this week. Lucian and Grant also had things going on so it was better for them to focus on other things as well. On Wednesday we improved the rough cut Ruby program to send an image to the engraver. It is now much more effecient and doesn't try to push too much data on the engraver. We also figure out that we can send 7 byte packets just fine they don't have to be single byte ones. 

We divided up some of the C code and I am working on writing the code to communicate with the engraver over USB. I am researching how it is done at the moment and I plan to get something wrote this week.
