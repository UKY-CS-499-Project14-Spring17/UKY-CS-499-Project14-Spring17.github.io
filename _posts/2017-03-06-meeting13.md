title: Meeting Log - Mar. 06

Today, we communicated with the engraver by replicating an image that had already been turned into bytecode. The process is rather simple:
~~`ruby parser.rb -x -o - rawData/better/cs499 > /dev/ttyUSB0`~~

(Updated: Mar. 22) We figured out the issue from our presentation. The parser uses:

```ruby parser.rb -x -o /dev/ttyUSB0 rawData/better/cs499```

This will run the parser in hex mode (```-x```) and by outputing to the stdout (`-o`), the bytecode can be directly sent to the serial port. Next, we'll be exploring the methods to encode the images into the serial bytecode.
