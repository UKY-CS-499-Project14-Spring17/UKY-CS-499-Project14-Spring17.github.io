No progress made over spring break (ugh).

Today, we fixed the engraver and found a typo I had made last week leading up to the presentation. The parsing software works again, and Patrick helped me fine-tune the ruby test parser to handle streaming the bytes properly. The htpow engraver now gets exactly as many bytes as it wants and we get along to the result much (2x-10x) faster. On smaller drawings, this really made a difference. We are ready to tackle translating these images into bytecode to stream to the engraver.
