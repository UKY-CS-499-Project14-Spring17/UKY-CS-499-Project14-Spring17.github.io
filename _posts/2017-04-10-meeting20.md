title: Meeting Log - Apr. 10
---

We met on Monday to create the testing table that Dr. Piwowarski wanted everyone to do. Grant and Patrick worked on that and created a rough outline for it while Lucian worked on getting greyscale engraving working in our program. Greyscale was sort of working by the end of the meeting but still needs work. We still need to get with Dr. Dietz about the G-Code interpreter and of course we still have a final presentation and report to get to as well as actually doing the testing.
