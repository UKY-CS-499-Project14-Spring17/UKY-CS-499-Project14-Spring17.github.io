![Modules, updated with grey portions complete](/images/modules_update.png)

The team discussed the remaining steps needed for the project. The image, in a [magickwand format](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/magick-wand.php), can be iterated over. The values will be fed, pixel by pixel, to the streamer, which will initialize the connection, transmit the pixel data, and close the connection. Grant will be working with the magickwand library and packaging the pixel data. Lucian will work on formatting the data into a bytestream. Patrick will work on writing the bytestream to the serial connection. When all three steps are complete, the basis of the project will be complete - black & white images will be transmittable via serial port connection to the laser engraver.

Additionally, the team today understood more of the initialization protocol. The first three signals given out by the software take the form of:

```bash

# upper left most pixel
1b:xx:xx:yy:yy:00:ff
# lower right most pixel
1b:xx:xx:yy:yy:01:ff
# draw the border box
1c:00:00:00:00:00:ff

```

The upper left most pixel is the upper-most x value (2 bytes) and the left-most y value (2 bytes), followed by an 0x00. The lower right most pixel is the upper-most x value (2 bytes) and the left-most y value (2 bytes), followed by an 0x01. Today, we manually issued these commands and verified that we can cause the engraver to loop through drawing the border box. The border seems to have a step precision somewhere below 1113 steps (0x439), though the exact value has not been verified. We attempted to draw a small shape in each corner of the supercarver software, but the software would crash and the engraver was uncooperative. We have not worked out the frame travel command yet, though we plan to this week.
