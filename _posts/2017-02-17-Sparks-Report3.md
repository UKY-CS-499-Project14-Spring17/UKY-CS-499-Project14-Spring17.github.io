### Feb. 13, 2017

We tried to work with the HTPOW software, but it seems that either the VM has an issue or the software doesn't have the right driver. We worked at it for a few hours this afternoon, with no real progress...

### Feb. 17, 2017

We replaced our Wednesday meeting with a Friday afternoon meeting this week. Lucian and Patrick got the software working and we're going to start running experiments on the engraver to define its resolution and speed, as these are going to be useful later on. We've started discussing our high-level design and I'm going to be doing a lot of the documentation on that to keep this work off of my teammates' plate. Our goal is to continue making progress deconstructing the engraver communication next week while we detail the high-level design. I'm also going to work on developing some images to test out our engraver.
