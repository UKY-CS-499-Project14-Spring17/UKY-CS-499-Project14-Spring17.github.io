### Jan. 30, 2017 ###

The team met with our customer, Dr. Dietz, and got a better idea of what the project entails. As it turns out there are some cheap laser engravers coming out of China right now, and Dr. Dietz has been playing around with a cheaper one. He has added more safety features and made an instructable on how to do so. The engraver runs using an unknown protocol and on a program that only runs on older version of Windows. Paul Eberhart has already decyphered some of the communications protocol. Our task is to finish figuring out the protocol and create a portable program that will run in Linux. 

Until we start diggin in to the project it is hard to determine how much we can get done but initially the goal is to create a terminal program that can send an image to the engraver to engrave. More advanced functionality such as changing the speed of cutting and optimizing the cutting route can be added later if time permits. We will also try to finish decyphering the control protocol but from the meeting it sounded as though it could be difficult and not completely necessary as long as the Linux program can do the base functionalities.
