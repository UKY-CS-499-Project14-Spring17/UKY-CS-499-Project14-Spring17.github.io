title: Meeting Log - Feb. 24
---

We met on Friday in the ECE lounge to discuss the presentation and report for next week as well as work on reverse engineering more of the engraver protocol. We will spend most of next week working on the report and presentation. The following is a summary of our recerse engineering so far.

Here's what we've discovered about the HTPOW format [(here's the horizontal example in full)](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/master/reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal.parse): <!-- TODO: version control this link to a specific md5 sum -->

```ruby
# reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal.parse
# both of these values increment over time (increasing x value)
#                       	vv vv vv
15:18:05.851535000	host	43:01:2c:02:14:00:ff

15:18:07.459209000	host	77:02:38:02:14:00:ff
```

```ruby
# reverseEngineering/rawData/better/vertical.parse
# both of these values increment over time (increasing y value)
#                       	vv       vv vv
15:17:16.122249000	host	5b:02:11:01:42:00:ff

15:17:16.122249000	host	5f:02:11:01:46:00:ff

15:17:17.826128000	host	4c:02:11:02:47:00:ff
15:17:18.598952000	3.9.2	3e:01:ff:ff:3e:2b:30:02:00:00:00:00:00:ff:ff
```

Although we don't know the exact bounds of the range, the second and third bytes control the x value; the fourth and fifth bytes control the y value; as the sixth byte is always 0x00 for this 'move' command, we expect that this is just padding for the 7 byte commands. All the files start with a close variation of this header, which sets some initial settings on the engraver. These will need to be investigated.

```ruby
# reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal.parse
15:18:02.486628000	3.9.0	
15:18:04.932095000	host	1b:01:26:02:14:00:ff
15:18:04.932095000	host	1b:02:38:02:14:01:ff
15:18:04.932095000	host	1c:00:00:00:00:00:ff
15:18:04.932095000	host	18:01:26:02:14:00:ff
15:18:04.932095000	host	15:01:01:00:00:00:ff
15:18:05.751527000	3.9.2	3e:02:ff:ff
```

Patrick noticed there is a pattern to every time 3e:0x:ff:ff is called:

```ruby
# reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal.parse
#                 	     	3e:02 called, host time = 0x3d (61)
15:18:05.751527000	3.9.2	3e:02:ff:ff
15:18:05.769241000	host	3d:01:26:02:14:00:ff
...
# ~0.9 s later    	     	3e:01 called, host time = 0x43
15:18:05.851472000	3.9.2	3e:01:ff:ff
...
# ~0.8 s later    	     	3e:02 called, host time = 0x76
15:18:06.648041000	3.9.2	3e:02:ff:ff
15:18:06.649061000	host	76:01:5f:02:14:00:ff
15:18:06.649061000	host	77:01:60:02:14:00:ff
15:18:06.649061000	host	78:01:61:02:14:00:ff
# the clock wraps around from 0x78 (120) to 0x3d (61) at this instruction
15:18:06.649061000	host	3d:01:62:02:14:00:ff
...
# ~0.8 s later    	     	3e:01 called, host time = 0x5b (91)
15:18:07.444671000	3.9.2	3e:01:ff:ff
15:18:07.459209000	host	5b:02:1c:02:14:00:ff
```

Although it is not apparent here, the engraver calls back to the computer about every 800 ms, trying to line up its packet with 0x3d (the first value possible in the first byte) and 0x5b (where 3e:02:ff:ff is triggered). Lastly, all engraving sessions end the same way - with a 0x09 packet and a double length packet (14 byte) response from the engraver:
