Met in the lab at 2pm. We received the proper version of the HTPOW software and Lucian successfully ran it on his computer's Windows VM. We also successfully installed [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and we were able to intercept the communication between the software and the engraver. We began deciphering the stream back and forth and the USB serial protocol.

Tasks for Next Week:

* Capture more samples of running engraver code
* Test the extreme limits resolution and pan
* Create an image to test resolution of the engraver
