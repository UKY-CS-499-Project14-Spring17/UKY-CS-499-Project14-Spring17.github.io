title: Meeting Log - Mar. 03

Today we communicated manually with the engraver. The procedure is outlined below.

First, determine which device corresponds to the engraver:

```bash
# Physically disconnect engraver
% ls > /tmp/dev_before
# Connect engraver
% ls > /tmp/dev_after
% diff /tmp/dev_before /tmp/dev_after
```
The different line is the engraver. In our case, it was `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

Next, start `screen`

```bash
#screen <device> <baudrate>
% screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200
```

In another terminal, open a tshark session as previously described previously

```bash
% sudo modprobe usb
# Determine bus and device ID
% lsusb
# sudo tshark -i usbmon<bus_ID> -Y 'usb.addr contains "<bus_ID>.<dev_ID>"' -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time -e usb.addr -e usb.data_len -e usb.capdata
% sudo tshark -i usbmon3 -Y 'usb.addr contains "3.12"' -T fields -e frame.number -e frame.time -e usb.addr -e usb.data_len -e usb.capdata
```

Now, we need to get out commands into a format that the device can understand

```bash
# -n suppresses newline, -e allows for \x escape
# echo -ne "\x<HEX>\x<HEX>\x<HEX>\x<HEX>\x<HEX>\x<HEX>\x<HEX>" > <file>
# Initialize
% echo -ne '\x1A\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\xFF' > ~/screenCMD0
# Set first bound
% echo -ne '\X1B\X02\X11\X01\X42\X00\XFF' > ~/screenCMD1
# Set second bound
% echo -ne '\X1B\X02\X11\X02\X47\X01\XFF' > ~/screenCMD2
# Draw box
% echo -ne '\X1C\X00\X00\X00\X00\X00\XFF' > ~/screenCMD3
```

Finally, in the `screen` window, type `<C-a>:` to bring up the command line, then type:

```bash
# readreg <reg> <file>
# <C-a>:
: readreg r /home/lucian/screenCMD0
# paste <reg>
# <C-a>:
: paste r
```

Repeat this for each command, being very careful not to type any other characters in the screen terminal. It won't echo them back, but it will send them to the device which will mess things up.
If done correctly, the device will issue a few status commands and then draw the bounds box for a vertical line.

To exit the screen session, type `<C-a>\y`

This obviously is a bit of a pain, so we're going to think of a better solution. But, it works! We also have updated the ruby parser, but it doesn't want to talk to the engraver quite right. Next week we should be able to stream some amount of data to the engraver procedurally.
