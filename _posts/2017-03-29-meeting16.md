title: Meeting Log - Mar. 29

We continued to work on the code for the sections we distributed last time. Grant and Lucian prepared an Arduino to act as a serial mirror that echoed back what it recieved to help Patrick in developing the serial communication code. We also determined the max size in pixels the engraver can physically cover. We sent the command to the engraver to draw a box, and kept increasing the size of the box until it could go no further. This was indicated very clearly by a slight grinding when the motors would hit the mechanical stops and keep trying to go further. Specifically, the commands we entered were:

1b 00 00 00 00 00 ff
1b XX XX YY YY 01 ff
1c 00 00 00 00 00 ff

Where XX and YY steadily increased until we found a safe value of around 05 00 for each, or 500 in hex. This translates to a max image size somewere around 1280 pixels by 1280 pixels, or 1,638,400 square pixels.
