title: Meeting Log - Apr. 05

We met on Wednesday with the code changed to count correctly. The stick man now printed as expected. We had an extra line engraving at the bottom of any image that we tried. This turned out to be some artifact of the image manipulation and Grant was able to fix it rather quickly. Once the image was engraving with no line and exactly as expected we decided to leave a little early to enjoy the nice day before inclement weather struck.
