title: Meeting Log - Apr. 25

Grant and Patrick met on Tuesday to work on testing. The Makefile and main.c were edited quite a bit to support the automated testing suite of the main.c file.

Due to the team being so busy with other things at the end of the semester we have fallen behind on documentation and keeping current with these team logs and personal logs. Mostly we have been working on the final presentation, testing, and finishing up a last few things such as being able to change laser intensity and dwell time.
