title: Meeting Log - Feb. 27
---

The team met this afternoon and discussed further plans in preparation for the presentation next week.

Lucian and Patrick ran tests using the greyscale format, which provided interesting results. Grant documented the known protocol - including the new greyscale signals - [which is available here](/protocol.html). The module design is a little more clearly established now:

Grant is going to work with the ImageMagick library, as he already has a little experience with it, as well as option parsing. Lucian and Patrick are going to focus on the streamer code, and determining how to get the bytes in a format that the engraver will respond. The team finalized some aspects of the presentation and continued working to understand the greyscale protocol.

Grant and Patrick spent most of the time during the meeting developing the top-level diagram above while Lucian collected data using the greyscale option of the SuperCarver software. There was mixing between however when trouble spots came up, such as the engraver consistently breaking on a certain image or difficulty in deciding how to present the top level design. 

One of the more interesting events during the meeting was one where the engraver software stopped responding in the middle of engraving an image. Meaning the software was just a white screen and the task bar said not responding. In this state if Lucian moved the window the engraver would start to engrave more, so we were able to finish the engraving by moving the window around even with the software not responding.
