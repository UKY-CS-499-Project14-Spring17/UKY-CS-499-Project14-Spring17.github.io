title: Meeting Log - Feb. 27

The team met this afternoon and discussed further plans in preparation for the presentation next week.

Lucian and Patrick ran tests using the greyscale format, which provided interesting results. Grant documented the known protocol - including the new greyscale signals - [which is available here](/protocol.html). The module design is a little more clearly established now:

Grant is going to work with the ImageMagick library, as he already has a little experience with it, as well as option parsing. Lucian and Patrick are going to focus on the streamer code, and determining how to get the bytes in a format that the engraver will respond. The team finalized some aspects of the presentation and continued working to understand the greyscale protocol.
