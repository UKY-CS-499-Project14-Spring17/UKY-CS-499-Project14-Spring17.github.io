### Feb. 12, 2017

We met twice over the week. The first time on Monday we dinished the website layout and requirements. Then on Wednesday we met at Marksbury with Dr. Dietz and got him to agree to the requirements as well give us access to the lab where the engraver is. Dr. Dietz is also going to be buying another engraver for us to use at home.

I edited a lot of our website pages and made changes for clarity. Specifically I filled out the schedule and added to the meeting logs. I also researched GCode and rasterisation which are topics that Dr. Dietz had mentioned but I knew nothing about. It turns out GCode is a generic term for code used to control machines like CNC machines and is not a well defined code in and of itself. Everyone who makes one of those types of machines ends up using some form of GCode but is always its own unique implementation. Part of our job is to basically figure out the GCode for this engraver. Rasterization is turning an image into pixels. Something we haven't really talked about yet is how we turn the image into an engraving. We have been focusing on determining what the control protocol for the engraver is, but once we figure out how to tell the engraver where to move we will then need to be able to tell the engraver how to cut the pattern of the picture. There maybe some free software that can help us with this or maybe I am overthinking it. We will see.
