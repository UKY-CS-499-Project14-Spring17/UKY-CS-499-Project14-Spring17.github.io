### Feb. 08, 2017

Class ran over for me, so I didn't meet with Dr. Dietz today, but it sounds like we got a lot of good clarification from him. I'm going to be handling all the documentation moving forward (as is reasonable), so I'll be posting the meeting notes and updating the website (outside of people's weekly updates) as needed. I'm also going to be handling the documentation for our software, which means clean, readable comments and good test cases. Lastly, I'm going to be helping with coding, though designing won't be my focus, just implementing. Once we get the signal decoded, I'll really be hitting the ground with my part. I'm also going to be handling profiling and optimizing where needed, but it seems likely that gcc's -O command will be able to do far better than I will where needed.
