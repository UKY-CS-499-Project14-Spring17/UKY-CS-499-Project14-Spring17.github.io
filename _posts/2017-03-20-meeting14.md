title: Meeting Log - Mar. 22
---

Today, we corrected the errors from the presentation two weeks ago. The code documented from the Mar. 06 meeting was not correct. Patrick has a very complete understanding of the protocol; while working with Grant, they fixed the parser.rb file to read and write at the fastest speed possible that the engraver can handle.

Lucian tackled some of the remaining bugs in the parser and used it to test against an [X shape](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/e6d4542624304241cd4d75077b2b242efff3f0aa/reverseEngineering/rawData/better/x.png). The [sample below](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/98d09e71053f05a4bf4f2b1b9b72b5ab08ed560c/reverseEngineering/rawData/better/x.timing) shows the response time from the engraver starting at 2.1 seconds (when the X is wide at the top), dropping to 0.2 seconds (where the X converges and the tray does not move much), rising back to 2.4 seconds (when the legs of the X are far apart again).

This rise and fall pattern means that `3d:xx...` and `5b:xx...` are not sent until the device responds with a `3e:0x:ff:ff` packet. As this is the case, the device seems to have a hardware buffer that can hold at least 30 instructions. The supercarver software will always send the instructions in groups of 30. There are a few optimizations that can happen here. First, sending larger instruction groups means less waiting. Determining how to send exactly as many instructions as the engraver can handle would be ideal. Second, having 4 different engraving direction patterns would be ideal, even if a pathfinding algorithm is not possible. The X would be much faster to draw if the engraver would travel diagonally, rather than in vertical or horizontal lines. We are certain further improvements can be made, but for now we have an understanding to make our parser as fast as the supercarver software.
