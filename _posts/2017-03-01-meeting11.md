Grant completed the ImageMagick handler, which can do both greyscale and threshold (b&w) images. The CLI parser is nearly complete, and the team is approaching a workable demo for the presentation next week. The team finalized the presentation and divided the presentation so that each member has a portion to discuss next week.
