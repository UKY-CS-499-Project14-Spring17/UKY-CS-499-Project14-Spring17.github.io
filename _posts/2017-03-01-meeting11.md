title: Meeting Log - Mar. 01
---

We had our meeting with the instructor during class time today. The meeting went well and there were no concerns from him. After that we met during our normal time at 2 in the ECE lab. In the lab we concentrated on finishing the slides for our presentation next Wednesday. Lucian was running late from a meeting and didn't have a lot of time to stay, so Grant and Patrick made several polishing passes and resolved a few issues with the content of the slides. We were all able to finish the slides we distributed up at the previous meeting before we broke for the day.

Grant completed the ImageMagick handler, which can do both greyscale and threshold (b&w) images. The CLI parser is nearly complete, and the team is approaching a workable demo for the presentation next week. The team finalized the presentation and divided the presentation so that each member has a portion to discuss next week.
