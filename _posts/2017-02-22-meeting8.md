title: Meeting Log - Feb. 22
---

The team met for two hours this afternoon to continue examining the results of the previous trials, but did not run further trials, though they are needed. Lucian and Patrick detailed the raw Wireshark outputs. Grant developed a parser, which is [available here](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/master/reverseEngineering/parser.rb), to group the bytes sent into something more human-readable.

Here's what we know so far about the format [(here's this example in full)](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/188e7e8d1ea16d9267589e5794e88972809ea1f3/reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal):

```ruby
# this communication is set from the computer to the USB driver
1	Feb 20, 2017 15:18:02.486449000 EST	host,3.9.0	0	
# the USB driver responds, giving the 3.9.2 port for the engraver
2	Feb 20, 2017 15:18:02.486628000 EST	3.9.0,host	18	
# the SuperCarver software sends some diagnostic data
307	Feb 20, 2017 15:18:04.932095000 EST	host,3.9.2	1	1b
# the USB protocol always acknowledges with a null packet

318	Feb 20, 2017 15:18:04.943365000 EST	3.9.2,host	0	
# every 7th byte from host is 0xff, which seems to end the command
319	Feb 20, 2017 15:18:04.945595000 EST	host,3.9.2	1	ff

[This raw file](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/188e7e8d1ea16d9267589e5794e88972809ea1f3/reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal) in full, is 1764 lines, but ~50% of this is null packets and most of the rest are seven 1 byte packets of a 7 byte message. All of this information is [parsed and shortened](https://github.com/UKY-CS-499-Project14-Spring17/htpewpew/blob/master/reverseEngineering/rawData/better/horizontal.parse) by Grant's parser to 131 packets (< 10% of the line count, ~5% of the file size):

```ruby
15:18:02.486628000	3.9.0	
# this is the same packet data as 307-320
15:18:04.932095000	host	1b:01:26:02:14:00:ff
```

We have not yet discussed the full file from Monday's crash, but we plan to meet again Friday, if possible, to examine where the process failed. We continued to discuss our [High-Level Design](hld.md) and midterm presentation, which has an outline. We need to develop our top-level code modules, project sizing, and CLI description. With this information, our presentation and design should be complete.
