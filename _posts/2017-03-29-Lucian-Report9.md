### Mar. 29, 2017 

At the meeting today, we decided that Grant and I are going to split up the unit testing.
He's going to write the tests for the image processing, and I'll do the rest.

I'm also going to write the functions for the streamer.
These funcitons will call the pixelator to get pixel information, then process them into the final commands which will be sent to the engraver.
