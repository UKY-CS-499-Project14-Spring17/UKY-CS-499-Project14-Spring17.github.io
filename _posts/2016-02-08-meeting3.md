The team met with Dr. Dietz and discussed requirements. Details were added regarding requirements and platforms.

The platform will be designed and tested for Ubuntu 16.04 and 14.04, though we expect that all major distributions of Linux should be compatible with this program. Target language is C/C++, pending library availability. Requirements are now listed in priority order on the homepage.
