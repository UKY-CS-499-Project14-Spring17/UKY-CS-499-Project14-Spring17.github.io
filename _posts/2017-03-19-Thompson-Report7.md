### Mar. 19, 2017

This week was spring break and although we said we could work on the project I myself did not. Lucian was out of town all week and Grant did not contact me about doing anything. Whether they did anything or not I don't know, but I expect we will be hitting the project very hard in the coming weeks. I still feel confident we can deliver on our requirements by the deadline.
